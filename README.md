# MongoDB $in Operator with Multiple Null Values

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to the usage of the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries when dealing with multiple null values.

## Bug Description
The `$in` operator is used to match documents where a field's value is present within a specified array. However, when this array contains only null values, the behavior can be unpredictable and may not return the expected results. This bug shows that the query may incorrectly return an empty array instead of documents where the field is null.

## Solution
To correctly retrieve documents where a field is null, use the `$eq` operator instead of `$in`. The `$eq` operator explicitly checks for equality with a value including null.

## How to reproduce the bug and fix
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `bug.js` to see the incorrect behavior
3. Run `bugSolution.js` to see the correct implementation using `$eq`
